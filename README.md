# GeoCollect
Field based asset management made simple!

GeoCollect aims at simplifying the managmement of assets in-the-fields through an integrations between a geospatial back-end based on PostGIS and GeoServer as well as geospatial application built for Androids which has the capability to perform work offlines.

GeoCollect has been designed with scalability and performance in mind. It can be proficiently used to manage a handful of asset as well as thousands of them with no problems.

GeoCollect has the concept of Surveys at its core, as such we have built a comprehensive and flexible App that will allow you to work offline carrying along all the cartographic data you need.
In case that was not clear you can do all your work in the field being OFFLINE!

GeoCollect is currently delivered through the Cloud hence no complex set up is needed. You can define the properties of your assets, the elements for your surveys and you are set to go. In order to help you out we will provide a certain number of sample missions to start from.

That said we on-premises installations are possible following the deploying guide in the documentation.
